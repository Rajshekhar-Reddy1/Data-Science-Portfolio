    - [Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/Shantanu9326/Telecom-Customer-Churn/blob/master/Telecom_Customer_Churn.ipynb):Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. One industry in which churn rates are particularly useful is the telecommunications industry, because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a geographic location.- Data Source: The dataset is available on kaggle [data source](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and you can directly read this notebook into Google Colaboratory. By building a model to predict customer churn with Logistic Regression, ideally we can nip the problem of unsatisfied customers in the bud and keep the revenue flowing.
