	- [Data Visualization: Corruption and Human Development](): The purpose of this project is to perform data visualization to explore the relationship between Corruption and Human Development across various nations based on UN Human Development Report.  A scatter plot for the relationship between the 'Human Development Index' and the 'Corruption Perceptions Index' of countries.

    - [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Shantanu9326/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/master/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb): The purpose of this project is to perform data visualization to explore the relationship between Corruption and Human Development across various nations based on UN Human Development Report.  A scatter plot for the relationship between the 'Human Development Index' and the 'Corruption Perceptions Index' of countries. 
    - [Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/Shantanu9326/Telecom-Customer-Churn/blob/master/Telecom_Customer_Churn.ipynb):Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. One industry in which churn rates are particularly useful is the telecommunications industry, because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a geographic location.- Data Source: The dataset is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) data source and you can directly read this notebook into Google Colaboratory. By building a model to predict customer churn with Logistic Regression, ideally we can nip the problem of unsatisfied customers in the bud and keep the revenue flowing.
    - [Directing Customers to Subscription Through App Behavior Analysis]():In today’s market, many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products, which originate from free ones, are Youtube Red, Pandora premium, audible subscription, and you need a budget. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.
    - [Minimizing Churn Rate Through Analysis of financial habits]():Subscription Products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries. These products can come in the form of a ‘one size fits all’ overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level memberships. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, or what industry they are in, companies almost try to minimize customer churn (a.k.a subscription cancellations).To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify the behavioural pattern that acts as a catalyst in disengagement with the product.
