    - [Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/Shantanu9326/Telecom-Customer-Churn/blob/master/Telecom_Customer_Churn.ipynb):Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. One industry in which churn rates are particularly useful is the telecommunications industry, because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a geographic location.- Data Source: The dataset is available on kaggle [data source](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and you can directly read this notebook into Google Colaboratory. By building a model to predict customer churn with Logistic Regression, ideally we can nip the problem of unsatisfied customers in the bud and keep the revenue flowing.
    - Directing-Customers-to-Subscription-Through-App-Behavior-Analysis
In today’s market, many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products, which originate from free ones, are Youtube Red, Pandora premium, audible subscription, and you need a budget. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.

Market: The target audience is customers who use a company’s free product. In this case study, this refers to users who installed (and used) the company’s free mobile app.
Product: The paid memberships often provide enhanced versions of the free products already given for free, alongside new features. For example,Youtube Red allows you to leave the app while still listening to a video.
Goal: The objective of this model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to “convert” them to paid users.
In this case study, we will be working for a fintech company that wants to provide its customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track all of their finances in one place. To attract customers, the company releases a free version of their app with some of the main features unlocked.The company has tasked you to identify which users will most likely NOT enrol in the paid product so that additional offers can be given to them.Because of the costs of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody,especially customers who were going to enrol anyways.
